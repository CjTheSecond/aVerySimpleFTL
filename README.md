# aVerySimpleFTL
A very simple Flash Translation Layer which can be linked between Elm Chan's FAT FS and any NOR flash

Here I hope to make a simple FTL with a Look-Up table in the first few pages, then the main memory, and the some extra memory that we can use when the main memory wears out. Basically just how the great big SD card manufactures are doing it, but way wat simpler.
